	Problem: Devin's job is centered around consuming information. As a result, he reads a lot of books. Those who respect Devin
			for his expertise want to read some of the books and articles that he's reading. Devin frequenlty makes book 
			recommendations on-stream, during videos, and in Discord chats, however, this information is scattered in a multitude 
			of places.
			
	Solution: Devin Nash Books is an open-source hub for Devin's recommended books that is accessible to the public and easy to 
			view. The links for each book are Amazon Smile links that support a charity of the user's choice.
